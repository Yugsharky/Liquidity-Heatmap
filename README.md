# Liquidity-Heatmap
A TradingView Pine Script‚Ñ¢ indicator that highlights liquidity zones using PVSRA (Price, Volume, Support/Resistance Analysis) or VSA (Volume Spread Analysis). Each zone is assigned a probability score (20‚Äì85%) based on volume strength, distance from price, trend alignment, and volatility.

‚ú® Features

Dual Mode: Switch between PVSRA and VSA logic.

Probability Scoring: Zones ranked by hit likelihood with labels (green = strong, yellow = moderate, red = weak).

Dynamic Zone Sizing: Adjustable by ATR, % of candle, or ticks.

Aging & Fading: Zones gradually fade with time for clarity.

Statistics Panel: Tracks prediction accuracy, expected vs. actual hits, and assigns a quality rating.

Configurable Inputs: Control volume thresholds, wick size, ATR multipliers, zone limits, and more.

üìä How It Works

Detects high-volume candles with specific price action (climaxes, springs, upthrusts, wide spreads).

Creates support or resistance zones based on the candle structure.

Assigns each zone a probability score (heuristic formula).

Displays ongoing statistics to evaluate performance.

VSA vs PVSRA Zones
Mode	What it highlights	Best use for
PVSRA	High-volume support/resistance zones based on price + volume	Good for seeing structural zones where smart money might enter/exit. Works well with your order flow context.
VSA	Volume Spread Analysis: climaxes, upthrusts, springs	More focused on traps and potential reversals. Useful if you want zones where price may reject.

Rule of Thumb for You:

If you want zones likely to be touched ‚Üí use PVSRA.

If you want zones likely to cause a reaction or trap ‚Üí use VSA.

üîß Requirements

Would you like me to also make a short tagline version (like the one-line description you‚Äôd put at the very top of the README under the title)?
